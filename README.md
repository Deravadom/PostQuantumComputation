# PostQuantumComputation
Many cryptographic systems are based on RSA encryption and Prime Number Factorization. Shorâ€™s algorithm and Quantum Computers will render this method obsolete. This class will look at how prime number impact cryptography and why quantum algorithms can break these methods. It will then look at modern methods to encrypt in a quantum world.
